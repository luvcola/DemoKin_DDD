# 1. Installation

Install the [development version from GitHub](https://github.com/IvanWilli/DemoKin) (could take ~1 minute). We made changes to the `DemoKin` package ahead of this workshop If you had already installed the package, please uninstall it and and install it again.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# remove.packages("DemoKin")
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Load packages: 

```{r, warning=F, message=FALSE}
library(DemoKin)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(fields)
library(knitr)
```

# 2. Built-in data

The `DemoKin` package includes data from Sweden as an example. 
The data comes from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) and [Human Fertility Database](https://www.humanfertility.org/). 
These datasets were loaded using the`DemoKin::get_HMDHFD` function.

### 2.1. `swe_px` matrix; survival probabilities by age (DemoKin's *U* argument)

This is what the data looks like:

```{r}
data("swe_px", package="DemoKin")

swe_px[1:4, 1:4]
```

And plotted over time and age:

```{r}

image.plot(
  x = as.numeric(colnames(swe_px))
  , y = 0:nrow(swe_px)
  , z = t(as.matrix(swe_px))
  , xlab = "Year"
  , ylab = "Survival probability"
  )
```

### 2.2. `swe_asfr` matrix; age specific fertility rate (DemoKin's *f* argument)

This is what the data looks like:

```{r}
data("swe_asfr", package="DemoKin")

swe_asfr[15:20, 1:4]
```

And plotted over time and age:

```{r}
image.plot(
  x = as.numeric(colnames(swe_asfr))
  , y = 0:nrow(swe_asfr)
  , z = t(as.matrix(swe_asfr))
  , xlab = "Year"
  , ylab = "Age-specific fertility (f)"
  )
```

# 3. The function `kin()`

`DemoKin` can be used to compute the number and age distribution of Focal's relatives under a range of assumptions, including living and deceased kin. The function `DemoKin::kin()` currently does most of the heavy lifting in terms of implementing matrix kinship models. 
This is what it looks like in action, in this case assuming time-invariant demographic rates:

```{r}
# First, get vectors for a given year
swe_surv_2015 <- DemoKin::swe_px[,"2015"]
swe_asfr_2015 <- DemoKin::swe_asfr[,"2015"]
# Run kinship models
swe_2015 <- kin(U = swe_surv_2015, f = swe_asfr_2015, time_invariant = TRUE)
```

## 3.1. Arguments

- **U** numeric. A vector (atomic) or matrix of survival probabilities with rows as ages (and columns as years in case of matrix).
- **f** numeric. Same as U but for fertility rates.
- **time_invariant** logical. Assume time-invariant rates. Default TRUE.
- **output_kin** character. kin types to return: "m" for mother, "d" for daughter, ...
- **birth_female** numeric. Female portion at birth. Default as 1/2.04
## 3.2. Relative types

Relatives for the `output_kin` argument are identified by a unique code.
Note that the relationship codes used in `DemoKin` differ from those in Caswell [-@caswell_formal_2019]. 
The equivalence between the two set of codes is given in the following table:

```{r}

demokin_codes()
```

## 3.4. Value

`DemoKin::kin()` returns a list containing two data frames: `kin_full` and `kin_summary`. 

```{r}
str(swe_2015)
```

### `kin_full` 

This data frame contains expected kin counts by year (or cohort), age of Focal, and age of kin. 

```{r}
head(swe_2015$kin_full)
```

### `kin_summary`

This is a 'summary' data frame derived from `kin_full`. To produce it, we sum over all ages of kin to produce a data frame of expected kin counts by year or cohort and age of Focal (but *not* by age of kin). 
This is how the `kin_summary` object is derived:

```{r, message=F}
kin_by_age_focal <- 
  swe_2015$kin_full %>% 
  group_by(cohort, kin, age_focal) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(living)) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Check that they are identical (for living kin only here)

kin_by_age_focal %>% 
  select(cohort, kin, age_focal, count) %>% 
  identical(
    swe_2015$kin_summary %>% 
      select(cohort, kin, age_focal, count = count_living) %>% 
      arrange(cohort, kin, age_focal)
  )

```

# 4. Example: kin counts in time-invariant populations

Following Caswell [-@caswell_formal_2019], we assume a female closed population in which everyone experiences the Swedish 1950 mortality and fertility rates at each age throughout their life.
We then ask:

> How can we characterize the kinship network of an average member of the population (call her 'Focal')?

For this exercise, we'll use the pre-loaded Swedish data.

```{r}
# First, get vectors for a given year
swe_surv_2015 <- DemoKin::swe_px[,"2015"]
swe_asfr_2015 <- DemoKin::swe_asfr[,"2015"]
# Run kinship models
swe_2015 <- kin(U = swe_surv_2015, f = swe_asfr_2015, time_invariant = TRUE)
```

## 4.1. 'Keyfitz' kinship diagram

We can visualize the implied kin counts for a Focal woman aged 35 yo in a time-invariant population using a network or 'Keyfitz' kinship diagram [@Keyfitz2005] with the `plot_diagram` function:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
swe_2015$kin_summary %>% 
  filter(age_focal == 35) %>% 
  select(kin, count = count_living) %>% 
  plot_diagram(rounding = 2)
```

## 4.2. Living kin

Now, let's visualize how the expected number of daughters, siblings, cousins, etc., changes over the lifecourse of Focal (now, with full names to identify each relative type using the function `DemoKin::rename_kin()`).

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  rename_kin() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(age_focal, count_living))  +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 35, color=2)+
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Focal's age") +
  facet_wrap(~kin)
```

> Note that we are working in a time invariant framework. You can think of the results as analogous to life expectancy (i.e., expected years of life for a synthetic cohort experiencing a given set of period mortality rates).

How does overall family size (and family composition) vary over life for an average woman who survives to each age?

```{r}
counts <- 
  swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  group_by(age_focal) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count_living)) %>% 
  ungroup()

swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  select(age_focal, kin, count_living) %>% 
  rename_kin(., consolidate_column = "count_living") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_focal, y = count)) +
  geom_area(aes(fill = kin), colour = "black") +
  geom_line(data = counts, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Focal's age", y = "Number of living female relatives") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 6)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## 4.3. Age distribution of living kin

How old are Focal's relatives? Using the `kin_full` data frame, we can visualize the age distribution of Focal's relatives throughout Focal's life. For example when Focal is 35, what are the ages of her relatives:


```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
swe_2015$kin_full %>%
DemoKin::rename_kin() %>%
filter(age_focal == 35) %>%
ggplot() +
geom_line(aes(age_kin, living)) +
geom_vline(xintercept = 35, color=2) +
labs(y = "Expected number of living relatives") +
theme_bw() +
facet_wrap(~kin)

```

## 4.4. Deceased kin

We have focused on living kin, but what about relatives who have died during her life? 
The output of `kin` also includes information of kin deaths experienced by Focal.

We start by considering the number of kin deaths that can expect to experience at each age. In other words, the non-cumulative number of deaths in the family that Focal experiences at a given age.  

```{r}
loss1 <- 
  swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  filter(age_focal>0) %>%
  group_by(age_focal) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count_dead)) %>% 
  ungroup()

swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  filter(age_focal>0) %>%
  group_by(age_focal, kin) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count_dead)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename_kin(., consolidate_column = "count") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_focal, y = count)) +
  geom_area(aes(fill = kin), colour = "black") +
  geom_line(data = loss1, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Focal's age", y = "Number of kin deaths experienced at each age") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 0.086)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Now, we combine all kin types to show the cumulative burden of kin death for an average member of the population surviving to each age:

```{r}
loss2 <- 
  swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  group_by(age_focal) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count_cum_dead)) %>% 
  ungroup()


swe_2015$kin_summary %>%
  group_by(age_focal, kin) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count_cum_dead)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  rename_kin(., consolidate = "count") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_focal, y = count)) +
  geom_area(aes(fill = kin), colour = "black") +
  geom_line(data = loss2, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Focal's age", y = "Number of kin deaths experienced (cumulative)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

A member of the population aged 15, 50, and 65yo will have experienced, on average, the death of `r loss2 %>% filter(age_focal %in% c(15, 50, 65)) %>% pull(count) %>% round(1) %>% paste(., collapse = ", ")` relatives, respectively. 

# 5. Example: kin counts in time-varying populations
The real population is Sweden is not stable: individuals in it experience changing mortality and fertility rates throughout their life.
Kinship structures in populations with changing rates can be computed following Caswell and Song [-@caswell_formal_2021].

All the outputs that we showed for stable populations in the previous section are also available for non-stable populations (e.g., kin counts, deceased kin, and age distributions). 
In this section we'll focus on outputs that are specific to time-varying kinship structures. 
In particular, we'll show period, cohort, and age results for Sweden (Figure 5 from Caswell and Song [-@caswell_formal_2021]). 

Note that, in order to arrive a this results, we use a different set of input values. 
The objects `U_caswell_2021`, `f_caswell_2021`, and `pi_caswell_2021` were extracted by Ivan Williams from the supplementary materials provided by Caswell and Song [-@caswell_formal_2021].
They are included in DemoKin by default. 

```{r}
data(package="DemoKin")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(package="DemoKin")$results[1:3,3:4] %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  kable()
```
## 5.1. Arguments for time-varing model
- **pi** numeric. A matrix with distribution of childbearing with rows as ages and columns as years. Coincident with `U`.
- **output_period** integer. Year for which to return kinship structure. Could be a vector. Should be within input data years range.
- **output_cohort** integer. Year of birth of focal to return as output. Could be a vector. Should be within input data years range.

## 5.2. Period perspective

Our first illustration refers to a **period view** of kin counts. 
Following Caswell, we consider a population that experienced the demographic rates given as input to `DemoKin` and ask:

> How many living daughters would an average woman have at different ages, if we conducted a survey at a given point in time?
In order to provide these results, we re-run the `kin()` function with the `time_invariant = FALSE` parameter and the input rates from Caswell and Song [-@caswell_formal_2021].
Note that we provide DemoKin with a vector of the period years for which we want to obtain the kin counts (i.e., in the `output_period` argument). 

```{r}
system.time(
swe_period <- 
  kin(
    U = U_caswell_2021
    , f = f_caswell_2021
    , time_invariant = FALSE
    , pi = pi_caswell_2021
    # Note that here fertility only includes female birth, 
    # so "birth_female" is set as 1 instead of the default value 1/2.04
    , birth_female = 1
    # Note that we use the 'output_period' parameters as input
    , output_period = c(1891,1951,2050,2120)
    # We're only interested in certain kin ties
    , output_kin = c("d","gd","m","gm","os","ys")
)
)
```

Now, we plot the expected number of living daughters that Focal throughout her life at different points in time:

```{r}
swe_period$kin_summary %>%
  filter(kin == "d") %>% 
  rename_kin() %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age_focal,count_living,color=year)) +
  geom_line(size=1)+
  labs(x = "Focal's age", y = "Number of living daughters") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

In a similar way, we can ask, how many grand-daughters, sisters, etc., would an average woman have at different points in time?

```{r}
swe_period$kin_summary %>%
  rename_kin() %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age_focal,count_living,color=year)) +
  geom_line(size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~kin, scales = "free")+
  labs(x = "Focal's age", y = "Living kin count") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## 5.3. Cohort perspective

We can also visualize the results from a **cohort perspective**. 
This would be useful if we were interested in knowing the number of daughters of women in a given cohort at different points in time. 
We could as, for example:

> How many (living) daughters have women born in year 1951 accumulated by the year 2000, on average?
For a cohort perspective, we run the `kin()` function with the `time_invariant = FALSE` parameter and with a vector of `focal_year` values:
  
```{r}
system.time(
  swe_coh <- 
    kin(
      U = U_caswell_2021
      , f = f_caswell_2021
      , pi = pi_caswell_2021
      , time_invariant = FALSE
      , birth_female = 1
      # Note that we use the 'output_cohort' parameters as input
      , output_cohort = c(1891,1931,1971,2041)
      , output_kin = c("d","gd","m","gm","os","ys")
    )
)
```

Now, we can show the expected number of living daughters that women born in different cohorts have at their disposal in any given year:

```{r}
swe_coh$kin_summary %>%
  filter(kin == "d") %>% 
  rename_kin() %>% 
  mutate(year = cohort + age_focal,
         cohort = factor(cohort)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,count_living,color=cohort)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = seq(0,3,.2),breaks = seq(0,3,.2))+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of living daughters") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

We can do the same thing for other kin types to show the expected number of living kin for women born in a given cohort across time:

```{r}
swe_coh$kin_summary %>%
  rename_kin() %>% 
  mutate(year = cohort + age_focal,
         cohort = factor(cohort)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,count_living,color=cohort)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = seq(0,3,.2),breaks = seq(0,3,.2))+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~kin,scales = "free")+
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Living kin count") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

# 6. Exercises

**For all exercises, assume time-invariant rates at the 2010 levels in Sweden and a female-only population. All exercises can be completed using datasets included in DemoKin.**

## Exercise 1. Offspring availability and loss

Use `DemoKin` (assuming time-invariant rates at the 2010 levels in Sweden and a female-only population) to explore offspring survival and loss for mothers. 

**Answer**:  What is the expected number of surviving offspring for an average woman aged 65?

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

**Answer**: What is the cumulative number of offspring deaths experienced by an average woman who survives to age 65?

```{r}
# Write your code here
```



## Exercise 2. Mean age of kin

The output of `DemoKin::kin` includes information on the average age of Focal's relatives (in the columns `kin_summary$mean_age` and `kin_summary$$sd_age`). For example, this allows us to determine the mean age of Focal's sisters over the lifecourse of Focal: 

```{r}

swe_2015$kin_summary %>%  
  filter(kin %in% c("os", "ys")) %>% 
  rename_kin() %>% 
  select(kin, age_focal, mean_age, sd_age) %>% 
  pivot_longer(mean_age:sd_age) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_focal, y = value, colour = kin)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = "Mean age of sister(s)") +
  theme_bw()
```

**Instructions**

Compute the the mean and SD of the age of Focal's sisters over the ages of Focal **by hand** (i.e., using the raw output in `kin_full`). Plot separately (1) for younger and older sisters, (2) and for all sisters. 

First, get mean and SD of ages of sisters distinguishing between younger and older sisters:

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

Second, get ages of all sisters, irrespective of whether they are older or younger:

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

## Exercise 3. Living mother

What is the probability that Focal (an average Swedish woman) has a living mother over Focal's live? 

**Instructions**

Use DemoKin to obtain $M_1(a)$, the probability of having a living mother at age $a$ in a stable population. Conditional on focal's survival, $M_1{(a)}$ can be thought of as a survival probability in a life table: it has to be equal to one when $a$ is equal to zero (the mother is alive when she gives birth), and goes monotonically to zero. 

**Answer:** What is the probability that Focal has a living mother when Focal turns 70 years old?

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

# 7. Vignette and extensions

For more details on `DemoKin`, including an extension to time varying-populations rates, deceased kin, and multi-state models, see `vignette("Reference", package = "DemoKin")`. If the vignette does not load, you may need to install the package as `devtools::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin", build_vignettes = TRUE)`.

For a detailed description of extensions of the matrix kinship model, see:

- time-invariant rates [@caswell_formal_2019],
- multistate models [@caswell_formal_2020],
- time-varying rates [@caswell_formal_2021], and
- two-sex models [@caswell_formal_2022].

# 8. Appendix


## 8.1. Mean age of living kin

The output of the `DemoKin::kin()` function can also be used to easily determine the mean age Focal's relatives by kin type. 
For simplicity, let's focus on a Focal aged 35 yo and get the mean age (and standard deviation) of her relatives in our time-invariant population. 

```{r}
ages_df <- 
  swe_2015$kin_summary %>% 
  filter(age_focal == 35) %>% 
  select(kin, mean_age, sd_age)

ma <- 
  ages_df %>% 
  filter(kin=="m") %>% 
  pull(mean_age) %>% 
  round(1)

sda <- 
  ages_df %>% 
  filter(kin=="m") %>% 
  pull(sd_age) %>% 
  round(1)

print(paste0("The mother of a 35-yo Focal woman in our time-invariant population is, on average, ", ma," years old, with a standard deviation of ", sda," years."))
```

## 8.2. Visualizing living kin

Finally, let´s visualize the living kin by type and mean age during Focal's life course:

```{r}
swe_2015$kin_full %>%
  filter(kin %in% c("m", "gm", "d", "gd")) %>%
  rename_kin() %>% 
  group_by(age_focal, kin) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = sum(living)
    , mean_age = sum(living * age_kin, na.rm=T)/sum(living)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age_focal,mean_age)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size=count,color=kin)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=kin)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Age Focal", breaks = seq(0,100,10), labels = seq(0,100,10))+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Age kin", breaks = seq(0,100,10), labels = seq(0,100,10))+
  geom_segment(x = 0, y = 0, xend = 100, yend = 100, color = 1, linetype=2)+
  labs(color="Relative",size="Living")+
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_bw()
```
